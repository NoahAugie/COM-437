# BlueZone: Augason Skate Analysis

**Course:** Saint Leo University – COM-437 Mobile Application Development  
**Developer:** Noah Augason  
**App Name:** BlueZone  
**Short Name/Logo:** BZ  

## Project Description

BlueZone is a mobile app that helps skaters explore and evaluate skateparks around the California Bay Area. It offers information that matters both to experienced skaters and to families with young children. Users can browse a list of skateparks, view photos, check terrain types, and read short reviews. As a father of two young daughters who are both learning to skate, I created BlueZone to support both adult skaters and parents looking for safe, welcoming parks. Whether one is looking for bowls or just wants a clean place to skate with kids, my app aims to help.

My project blends personal experience with practical mobile development. I skate regularly with my two daughters, and we visit parks across the Bay. BlueZone will reflect that mix of adventure and safety, offering a balanced view of each park’s features.

## Problem Being Addressed

Skaters and families have no reliable app to compare local skateparks. Current tools are outdated, incomplete, or focused solely on one demographic. There's a need for clean, filterable information about each park's terrain type, cleanliness, difficulty, and safety all in one place. BlueZone fills that gap.

## Platform

- Android Studio
- Android SDK and Emulator
- Java/Kotlin
- Target: Modern Android devices (API 30+)
- No backend planned; data will be static or local in-app

## Front-End and Back-End Support

This is a front-end-only app. It will display static skatepark data using arrays or local JSON. Photos will be stored locally or hardcoded for initial build. If extended in future, a backend could support user submissions and live updates.

## Functionality

The app will:
- Display a scrollable list of Bay Area skateparks
- Show basic details: name, location, terrain type
- Provide detailed views with:
  - Cleanliness rating
  - Safety observations
  - Structural integrity notes
  - Terrain tags (bowl, vert, street)
  - Photos and comments
- Offer a link to the park in Google Maps

## Design Summary

- **Launch screen:** Splash view with BlueZone branding (BZ logo)
- **Home screen:** Scrollable list of parks, filterable by terrain or rating
- **Park detail screen:** View individual park profile with ratings, review tags, and photos
- **Optional future ideas:** Favorites list, kid-friendly filter, map view

## Personal Connection

This app blends my passion for skating with real-world needs as a dad. My daughters (ages 5 and 2) are learning to skate, so I visit parks often and pay attention to safety, layout, and family vibe. BlueZone will help others make better decisions when choosing where to ride.
